Each state functions like its own country with its cultural traditions, religion, rules, regulations, and language—there are 22 official languages recognized by the Indian constitution, but dozens more exist. India is a multilingual, multiethnic, multireligious society, so child adoption in India can be quite complex."

            android:text="The history of child adoption in India began in 1890. Under the Guardians and Wards Act, courts were allowed to appoint a guardian for an orphaned child. This was particularly revolutionary as the 1890 Act was a non-religious universal law pertaining to the guardianship of a child. In 1956, religion played a part in adoption under the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act. Under this act, all Hindu children eligible for adoption must be adopted by practicing Hindu parents. In 2000, the Juvenile Justice Act overturned the Hindu Adoption Act and, like the 1890 Act, allowed for the adoption of any eligible child to any prospective adoptive parent, regardless of religious beliefs. The Juvenile Justice Act was amended in 2015 to be even more secular and to formally allow for the adoption of Indian children to international families. Until 2015, there was no formal law regarding international adoption. The 2015 Act also established the Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) as the country’s central adoption authority. Through CARA, all institutions providing care for children were formally registered and a more streamlined database of available children was established. From April 2017 to March 2018, the most recent time frame from which data is available, 3,276 in-country adoptions and 651 intercountry adoptions in India occurred. In 2017, 221 intercountry adoptions occurred from India to the United States."

Children reside in state-run orphanages, which are monitored by CARA. Both healthy children and children with special needs are available for adoption, depending on the prospective adoptive parents’ status. Sibling groups are possible and are classified under special needs adoption."
